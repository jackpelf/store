Help on function findall in module re:

ffiinnddaallll(pattern, string, flags=0)
    Return a list of all non-overlapping matches in the string.
    
    If one or more groups are present in the pattern, return a
    list of groups; this will be a list of tuples if the pattern
    has more than one group.
    
    Empty matches are included in the result.
